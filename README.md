## DESIGN

#### Colours

Initially these colours were chosen for contrast while constructing the website and to help identify formatting conflicts. However, the proposed colours did not provide acceptable contrast to satisfy the accessiblity
criteria. 

The chosen colours contrasted nicely with either a black or white fonts. Thus aiding readability. Although there are a number of colours on the palette, some of them were mainly used to accentuate right, wrong answers and card answer selection. There is a subtle difference between white and smoke white. The colours are balanced, nicely contrasted with each other and does not overwhelm the user with colours. Also the coloured areas show nice separation such as the header, scoreboard and footer.

Green gives the user the vibe of right answer while red indicates wrong. Useful colours when writing a quiz app.

Main website colours:

#800080 - borders, scoreboard <br>
#ffa500 - background colour for feedback boxes and footer<br>
#4c161d - header<br>
#008000 - for background colour for card option with correct answer and background colour for tick<br>
#0000ff - for highlighting the user selected card by changing its left border <br>
#ffffff & #f5f5f5 - logo and main background colours <br>

Font colours:

White

#### Typeface

Typeface: Roboto Serif and Handlee

Fonts were obtained from Google Fonts. 

I like Roboto Serif for its clarity and modern design without distracting the user in terms of readability.

Handlee font was chosen for its quirkiness, sharpness and with a modern feel.

Both fonts are easy to read.

#### Wiroframes

Initially wireframes were drawn up prior to coding but was changed midway due to the complexity of coding.

The wireframes provide some basic web structures and is a good indication on how the website will function

While the wiroframes isn't an exact representation of the final product, they are similar. 

The images
